    <p>Hi, my name is Maduwuike Ikenna Fortune. I am learning HTML and excited to create my first webpage. I enjoy exploring new
        things and sharing my thoughts through writing.</p>
    <p>In class, I learned about HTML structure, headings, paragraphs, and how to add images to a webpage. It's
        interesting to see how web pages are built!</p>
